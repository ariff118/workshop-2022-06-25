## What is a Process Macro?  

. . .  

PROCESS is an observed variable OLS and logistic regression path analysis modeling tool.  

. . .  

The PROCESS macro is developed by Andrew F. Hayes.  

. . .  

It is widely used through the social, business, and health sciences for estimating direct and indirect effects in single and multiple mediator models (parallel and serial), two and three way interactions in moderation models along with simple slopes and regions of significance for probing interactions, and conditional indirect effects in moderated mediation models with a single or multiple mediators or moderators.

**What is "Conditional Process Analysis?"**\
Conditional process analysis is a modeling strategy undertaken with the goal of

::: callout
describing the *conditional* or *contingent* nature of the *mechanism(s)* by which a variable transmit its effect on another, and testing hypotheses about such contingent effects.
:::

**A melding of two ideas conceptually and analytically:**

- "**Process aanalysis**", used to quantify and examine the direct and indirect pathways through which an antecedent variable *X* and transmits its effect on a consequent variable *Y* through an intermediary *M*. Beeter known as `mediation analysis` these days.

- "**Moderation analysis**" used to examine how the effect of an antecedent *X* on a consequent *Y* depends on a third moderator variable *M* (`interaction`).

## Moderation vs Mediation Analysis\

Key differences from a deterministic point of view:  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}  
A mediator is **_the reason for the effect_** and acts like a “`middleman`” in the relationship between independent and dependent variables. If the mediator variable is removed, the causal link between independent and dependent variables disappears.
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}  
A mediator variable **MUST** be a causal result of the independent variable and a causal precursor of the dependent variable. In other words, **_a mediator contextualizes the effect_**.
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}  
A moderator variable `changes` the effect (`level of strength`, `direction`) between the independent and dependent variables. 
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}  
A moderator variable **MUST NOT** be the causal effect of the independent variable.
:::  

## Moderating Variable  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}  
A moderator specifies the `conditions under which a given effect occurs`, as well as the conditions under which the `direction (nature)` or `strength` of an effect vary.\
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-in}  
Baron and Kenny (1986, pp. 1174, 1178) describe a moderator variable as the following:\

::: callout
A **qualitative** (e.g., sex, race, class) or **quantitative** variable ... that affects the direction and/or strength of a relation between an independent or predictor variable and a dependent or criterion variable ... a basic moderator effect can be presented as an interaction between a focal independent variable and a factor (the moderator) that specifies the appropriate conditions for its operation.\
:::

::: callout
Moderator variables are typically introduced when there is an **unexpectedly weak or inconsistent relation between a predictor and a criterion variable**.
:::
:::  
  
::: {.fragment .fade-in}  
A `moderator` variable is one that `affects the relationship between two variables`, so that the nature of the impact of the predictor on the criterion varies according to the level or value of the moderator **(Holmbeck, 1997)**\
:::  
  
::: {.fragment .fade-in}  
A moderator `interacts with the predictor` variable in such a way as to have an impact on the level of the dependent\

**The Triangle Pattern**  
“The process of savoring exacerbates the relationship between the experience of positive events and the outcome of happiness. An individual who savors very little does not show any significant relationship between positive events and happiness, but someone who savors a lot shows a strong positive relationship. The greatest happiness is reported by those participants who reported experiencing high levels of positive events and also reported savoring to a high degree.”

**The Funnel Pattern**  
“Academic achievement by adolescents varies by degree of challenge in the academic environment moderated by the amount of parental warmth. The degree of academic challenge is unrelated to academic achievement under conditions of average parental warmth. In contrast, a positive relationship between academic challenge and academic achievement was noted under conditions of high parental warmth, but a negative relationship was noted under conditions of low parental warmth. The highest academic achievement scores were found for adolescents in high challenge environments who had warm parents, whereas the lowest academic achievement scores were obtained for adolescents in high challenge environments who had parents lacking in warmth.”

## What is Mediation in Research?  

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}  
**Definition**: A mediation variable explains the “*why*” and “*how*” relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y). In other words, **_mediation contextualizes the reason for the effect_**.  
:::  
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
In mediation analysis, the independent variable does not infer directly the dependent variable but rather through a third variable mediator or “**_middleman_**” between the two. In other words, if we remove the mediator variable, the causal effect between X and Y variables will cease to exist.  
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
A mediated model consists of two paths respectively the **direct effect** path (path A) between X and Y and the **indirect effect** path (path B and C) respectively from X → Me → Y as seen in the following figure.

- Next, is the coefficients, with impact of DV (Hope),IV (Negative Life Events), and the interaction effect to assess if there is moderation (Grit) or not.  
![](images/model1a_1_out3.png)  

In this example, since the interaction effect is significant, `Grit` moderates the relationship between `Negative Life Events` and `Hope`.  

Test of unconditional interaction, this shows the change in $R^2$ due to interaction $(X*W)$, this is also significant.  
![](images/model1a_1_out4.png)  

## Johnson-Newman intervals and simple slope analysis  

Johnson-Newman intervals tells you the range of values of the moderator in which the slope of the predictor is significant vs. nonsignificant at a specified alpha level.  

In simple terms Johnson-Newman identifies regions in the range of the moderators variable where the effect of the focal predictor on the outcome is statistically significant and non significant.

## Reporting Results  

1. The study assessed the moderating role of `Grit` on the relationship between `Negative Life Events` and `Hope`. The results revealed a positive and significant moderating impact of `Grit` on the relationship between `Negative Life Events` and `Hope` (b = 2.6055, t = 2.4792, p = .0136), supporting H1. Moderation analysis summary is presented in Table 1.  

2. Results of simple slope analysis conducted to better understand the nature of the moderating effects are shown in Figure 1. As can be seen in Figure 1, the line is much steeper for Low `Grit`. This shows that at Low `Grit`, the impact of `NLE` on `Hope` is much stronger in comparison to High `Grit`. Also shown in the figure, as the level of `Grit` increased, the strength of the relationship between `NLE` and `Hope` increased. This is due to the positive slope coefficient obtained and the negative impact of `NLE` and `Hope`.

## Problem Hypothesis  

The basic relationship under investigation is the association between social support (X) and depression (Y), and let us assume that this is significant and negative. Specifically, someone who experiences a high level of social support should also report being less depressed.  

The ModV (W) is introduced because we are interested in whether gender might affect this
basic relationship.  

For the moderation hypothesis, someone might envision one of two possibilities:  

(1) that the association between social support and depression will be greater for males because they report lower levels of both variables than females; that is, the association is more salient, or  

(2) someone might hypothesize that the association will be greater for females because
they are more attuned to the emotional landscape of the psyche.  

My view was that the former prediction was more likely to be obtained than the latter, so I sought to examine a data set to determine which of these possible outcomes would be supported. The proposed moderation, if it exists, should be evident in the interaction term (XW) predicting the outcome (Y).

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
It was predicted that males would evidence a stronger negative relationship between social support and depression than females because males' use of social support is less common and may be more salient.  
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
A regression analysis was performed to test this moderation hypothesis: Social support was the independent variable, gender was the moderating variable, and depression was the dependent variable.  
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
The social support variable was multiplied with the dummy-coded gender variable, and the two main effects and the interaction term were used in a hierarchical regression to predict depression.  
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
A significant main effect for gender was obtained (b = .92, p = .007), and it signified that females' depression levels, on average, were higher than males' depression levels.  
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
But this main effect was qualified by the significant interaction (b = -.82, p = .009),
which was graphed using the techniques recommended by Aiken and West (1991; see Figure).  
![](images/model1b_graph.png)  
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
The figure shows that females manifested a steeper slope between social support and depression than males.  
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
Simple slope analyses yielded the result that females manifested a significant negative slope, -0.60, p < .001, whereas males evidenced a nonsignificant slope, -0.09, p = .60.  
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
This result suggests that females' differential use of social support was significantly related to levels of depression, whereas no such association was noted for males.  
:::  

::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
Further, the largest difference in self-reported depression between the genders occurred under conditions of low social support, whereas males' and females' levels of depression were virtually identical under conditions of high social support.

## Module 4  

Model 4 - Mediation  

## Introduction

Up to this point, we have focused on how to perform moderation analysis using the Process Macro.  

Let's now examine how the influence between two constructs may take an indirect path through a third variable called a **mediator**.  

In this situation, the third variable will intervene on the influence of the two constructs.  

In testing if "mediation" or the presence of a mediator in a model, you need to understand some of the terminology that is used, such as **direct effect, indirect effect,** and **total effect**.

**Direct-Indirect-Effect**  
A `direct effect` is simply a direct relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable in presence of the Mediator (`c'`).  
:::  
::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
An `indirect effect` is the relationship that flows from an independent variable to a mediator and then to a dependent variable (`a*b`).  
:::  
::: {.fragment .fade-up}  
The term `total effect` is the combined influence of the direct effect between two constructs and the indirect effect flowing through the mediator (`c = c' + a*b`).

## How to Test Mediation?  

For our examples, we will be using a dataset containing continuous measures of student achievement, performance goals, mastery goals, interest, and anxiety. We also have a dummy coded variable reflecting gender identification (coded 0=identified male, 1=identified female).

Mediation Model Framework

We are testing whether the effect of mastery goals on student achievement is mediated by interest. This is an example of a simple mediation model.

Description of Model along with the different variables where Y is the Dependent Variable, X is the Independent Variable, and M is the Mediating Variable.  

Notice that for this example there are two Model Summary presented.  
Model Summary, provides summary of the model with R, , F statistic, and value for the overall model.  

`mastery` -> `interest` (Model Summary 1 - path `a`)

> We see that in the first (simple) regression, mastery goals is a significant (positive) predictor of interest (b=.7701, s.e.=.0858, p<.001). This coefficient reflects the direct effect of mastery on interest within the path model. [Notice that the standardized path coefficient is also provided, which is .6073.]  

`[mastery & interest]` -> `achieve` (Model Summary 2 - path `b` and `c'`)  

> We see that in the second regression, both mastery goals (b=.3613, s.e.=.0768, p<.001) and interest (b=.2106, s.e.=.0606, p=.0007) are significant, positive predictors of achievement. These coefficients reflect the direct effects of both interest (path `b`) and mastery goals (path `c'`) on achievement within the path model. 
[The standardized path coefficients for this portion of the model are .3967 and .2932 for mastery and interest, respectively.]  

`mastery` -> `achieve` (Model Summary 3 - path `c`)  

> We see that mastery goals is significant positive predictor of achievement (b=.5235, s.e.=.0634, p<.0001). Here, the output provide the total effect (path c) of IV to DV without the presence of the mediator. [The standardized path coefficient is .5748]  

::: callout-important  
The unstandardized indirect effect (.1622) of interest is calculated as the product of paths a (.7701) and b (.2106) from the previous regression models.  

This indirect effect is tested using bootstrap standard errors and confidence intervals.  

The null hypothesis is that the population indirect effect is zero, whereas the alternative is that the population indirect effect is non-zero. So if zero falls between the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval (again, the default is 95%), then you maintain the null. If zero falls outside of the interval, then you reject the null.  

Here, we reject the null.  

The total effect of X on Y, computed as DE + IE = .3613 + .1622 = .5325. Because zero (the null) does not fall between the lower and upper bound of the 95% confidence interval, we infer that total effect of mastery goals on achievement is significantly different from zero.  

The c_cs is the completely standardized total effect. It is computed as c_ps * Sx, where Sx is the standard deviation for X (in this case, mastery goals).   

The standard deviation for the X (mastery) variable is 1.399233. So, the completely standardized total effect is: .4108* 1.399233 = .5748.  

The c'_cs is the completely standardized direct effect. It is computed as c'_ps * Sx, where Sx is the standard deviation for X. The completely standardized direct effect is: .2835* 1.399233 = .3967.  

The partially standardized indirect effect is computed the unstandardized indirect effect divided by the standard deviation for Y: i.e., ab/ Sy. The standard deviation for Y is (again) 1.274432. As such, the partially standardized indirect effect is: .1622/ 1.274432 = .127.  

The standardized indirect effect is computed as the product of the standardized paths 'a' and 'b': IE=.6073*.2932=.178. We see this effect is significant, as 0 does not fall between the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval. [Note: This effect is also computed by multiplying the partially standardized indirect effect by the standard deviation for X.]
